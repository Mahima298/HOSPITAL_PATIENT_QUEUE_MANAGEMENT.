# HOSPITAL_PATIENT_QUEUE_MANAGEMENT.
This hospital system manages a patient queue 🏥. Critical patients are handled via a priority queue 🚨 for immediate care. Regular patients wait in a separate, standard queue. The system also displays real-time estimated wait times ⏱, providing transparency and managing patient expectations.
